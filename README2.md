### Work in progress

- **Update Automatic**
- **Scraping for another subtitle website**
- **Create Func For Search EN Subtitle**
- **Forget Password**

### Last Works

- **Remove WorldSubtitle.url From Download File ❌**

  > ‼️ I think that is not possible because we downloaded zip or RAR file and we most first unzip or unrar file and then go for delete file and it's impossible then for this version before buying a server we use this

- **in search for movie check movie alis**
  > !! Some movies have incorrect subtitles in the database we most check that
